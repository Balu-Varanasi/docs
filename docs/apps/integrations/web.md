Web app renders a form corresponding to the input fields in the app. When input is submitted, it streams output to the browser. The output is rendered using the output template.

Chatbot apps are rendered as a chat application that a user can have a conversation with. If the app has more than one input, the chatbot will render a form which takes all the input fields. The chatbot will then render the output template for each response.
